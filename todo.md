# Not just version
<!--
Note that I'm not talking about merely changing version numbers,
but actually changing your source code.
You don't want to upgrade, and then have your IDE underline
old patterns and deprecated code paths, for you to fix manually.

# Spring Boot Migrator

<!--
Another interesting development, is the Spring Boot Migrator project.
It builds upon OpenRewrite, to migrate projects towards Spring from other frameworks.
It takes a slightly different, more interactive approach, which will be helpful when Spring Boot 3 arrives in November.
